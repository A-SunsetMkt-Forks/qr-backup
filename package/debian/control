Description: paper backups of files using QR codes
 qr-backup takes file(s), and outputs a "paper backup": a printable
 black-and-white pdf full of QR codes. To back up your file, print
 the PDF. The pile of paper in your hand is now a backup of the file.
 .
 If your file is lost, corrupted, deleted, etc, you can restore from
 your paper backup. qr-backup reads the QR barcodes using your
 computer's webcam (or scanner) to get your file back.
