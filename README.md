Generate paper backups for Linux. Currently **command-line Linux only**.

**qr-backup** takes file(s), and outputs a "paper backup": a printable black-and-white pdf full of QR codes. To back up your file, print the PDF. The pile of paper in your hand is now a backup of the file.

If your file is lost, corrupted, deleted, etc, you can restore from your paper backup. qr-backup reads the [QR barcodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) using your computer's webcam (or scanner) to get your file back.
