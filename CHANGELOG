v1.1 (not released)
- Automatic digital restore check added, which uses zbarimg to test restore from the digital .pdf. The automatic check is only performed when input and output are files.
- Added `-o`, `--output` option to give the name of an output file.
- Bugfix (#6): Reading from stdin did not work correctly. Now it should.
- Bugfix (#7): The instructions are always full-page-width now.
- Code cleanup: QR code content generation, and actual QR code generation is separated
- Base64 encoding is now done within a QR code, not across QR codes. This is to support future erasure coding.
