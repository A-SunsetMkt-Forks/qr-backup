v1.1 (not released)
- Added the `--restore` option so qr-backup will do the restore for you.
- Added encryption. New command-line options:
  - `--encrypt PASS` uses a passphrase you supply.
  - `--encrypt generate` generates a random passphrase for you (printed on a
    separate page by default).
  - `--encrypt-print-passphrase` and `--no-encrypt-print-passphrase` turn the
    separate page on and off.
  - `--encrypt PASS` is also an option for restore.
- Automatic digital restore check added, which runs when you make a paper
  backup. It uses zbarimg to test restore from the digital .pdf. Currently the
  check sometimes fails because zbar is unreliable, so it only prints a
  warning.
- Added `-o`, `--output` option to give the name of an output file.
- Added `--instructions` option to pick how to print instructions. Options are
  as a cover sheet, on each page (the default), both, or neither.
- Added a english explanation of the restore process to the instructions. It's
  long so it's only on the cover sheet.
- Added the size (in bytes) of the file to the human-readable output.
- Added `--note` to add some user-chosen text to each page or the cover sheet.
- Format: Base64 encoding is now done within a QR code, not across QR codes.
  This is to support future erasure coding.
- Format: Codes are now labeled as "N01/50" rather than "01". This is to
  support multiple code types down the line, and to allow a progress bar during
  restore.
- Bugfix (#6): Reading from stdin did not work correctly. Now it should.
- Bugfix (#7): The instructions are always full-page-width now.
- Bugfix (#15): Generated PDF is always identical (except the included date).
  However --encrypt is inherently non-deterministic for good reasons.
- Bugfix (#17): Improved the CLI restore to work with multiple consecutive
  restores
- Bugfix (#18): Support digital restore check when qr-backup is used in a
  pipeline, by keeping input and output in memory.
- Code cleanup: QR code content chunking vs actual QR graphic generation is
  split into two functions

v1.0
- Generate a PDF from any file
- Built-in compression (on by default)
- Uses base64 encoding, nothing, or '\n' to '\b' replacement as needed to avoid
  newlines in restore output.
- Long files are output as multiple QR codes.

- Default page size is 500px x 600px
- Default settings are 8px scale, version 10 QR codes, using binary encoding
  and M error correction. Output is 3K/side on default settings.
- Font is DevaVuSans (included)

- Restore is Linux CLI only, using zbar and coreutils.
- Release tested on Linux CLI only.
- Added README, FAQ, and USAGE.
